I tried to reimplement a few graphs and results from the book "Quantitative Risk Management: Concepts, Techniques and Tools" by Alexander J. McNeil, RÃ¼diger Frey and Paul Embrechts, 2nd edition.

The results are at best partial and were mostly for my own illustration.

Some of the same code is also available from their official site https://qrmtutorial.org/r-code
